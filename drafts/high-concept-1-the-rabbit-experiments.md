In my [first post][first_post_link], I listed a few series of posts that I was considering writing on a regular basis. This is the first of one of them: High Concept documents. This will give me a chance to get some ideas that I have ~down on paper~ up on the internet and it will give my game design mind a good run around the block.

These documents will be more focused towards attracting people to work on the game, they will probably include some art (gives me an excuse to practice) and the post will end with my reflection of the game idea as a whole. And who knows? Maybe I will bring one of these ideas to these to light one day. Perhaps even create small-in-scope prototype for #1GAM. So without further ado, let's move on the document.
