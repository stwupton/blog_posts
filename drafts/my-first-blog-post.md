So I finally done it, I created my very own blog. With the help of my favourite programming language, [Dart][dartlang_site], a nice web framework called [Angular2][angular_site] and [GitHub Pages][github_pages_site], I have successfully managed to create this beauty. I can't describe the overwhelming feeling of relief as I am writing this as it's something that I have attempted to do and failed at doing for quite a while. I saw this tweet a couple of years ago...

# TODO: TWEET IMAGE HERE

A normal developer may have looked at that, laughed and thought, "yeah, I've been there." But for me I saw it as a challenge. My motivation to get this done once and for all went through the roof... then plummeted straight back down shortly after (hence why I'm writing this in 2017). But no matter, it's done now and I'm proud of myself for following it through. But it's not actually done is it? No, because now I actually have to write content.

So, that leads me on to the topic of this first post; what is this blog about? But I feel like that question needs answering with another layer of sub-questions, so what I'll do is list some FAQs below and answer them as best as I can. I call them "FAQs" because I frequently asked myself these exact questions throughout the making of this blog.

## Who am I?

My name is Steven Upton, I'm currently 22 and I live in the UK. I spend most of my time developing for the web; whether that's using TypeScript to build slot games for my full time job at iSoftBet or using Dart to make the web application for [Indecks][indecks_site] - a business I founded with a couple of friends from college. When I'm not at work, and my girlfriend and daughter allow me to have some time to myself, I delve deep into my wide variety of interest (which is too many) to learn and improve in order to transform my career into the enterprising, game creating spectacular that my 12 year old self imagined it would be.

## What content will I write?

I aim to get a post out once a week and the variety of the content will likely vary as much as my interests do. From game design, programming, writing fiction... the list does go on. But I do have a few "series" of posts in mind. Such as:

### High Concept Documents

This will be an opportunity for me to exercise my game design mind and create high concept documents for any ideas of games that I happen to think of. This will also give me an opportunity to practice drawing in attempt to help visually describe the games I will be writing about.

### #1GAM

[#1GAM][1gam_site] stands for "One Game a Month". It's a personal challenge that you give to yourself which involves starting and finishing a game in the time frame of one month. Again, this will be a good chance for me to practice actually developing a game and show my skills off to the world. It will also force me to make the scope for these games very small (something I always struggle with when starting personal projects).

### £100 Business

Now, I'm not currently in the position where this is viable. It's just an idea - an extremely intriguing one at that. Basically, get £100 and start a business with just that. I have always been interested in enterprise. In college I, along with my team, won two national enterprise competitions and entered into many more. Since my college days though, being involved in entrepreneurial activities hasn't been as much of a regular occurrence (apart from working on Indecks of course). So a challenge like this once in a while will really vamp up my ability to turn a start-up into an income generating business.

## Who will or should read this?

To be honest... me. That's not to say that nobody else should read it, it's just that this blog is really just for me to document my learning, my progress, build some sort of online portfolio and really just be creative with my writing. If it just so happens that someone else stumbles upon it, finds it interesting, helpful or insightful, then that's just a big fat plus.

So please, if you are one of those people, leave a comment. I am always up for networking with others and I would like to know if something on here has helped you in any way (or if you think you can help me). If you want get notified when a new post out I have included an Atom feed [here][feed_link].

Well, that concludes my first post. See you next week.
