I finally done it. I created my very own blog which was created with the help of my favourite programming language, [Dart][dartlang_site], and a light-weight library I quickly whipped together which is based on the Flux design pattern. You may ask, why go through all of that effort when I could have just used Blogger or Wordpress?

Like most developers I have a tendency to build things from the ground up, even though there is usually an amazing solution already out there which has been created by developers with far greater talent than I will ever have. And the reason why me and so many others do this is... well, it's fun.  

So the hard part is done, the site is up and running. Now it's time for the harder part; writing content. So that leads me onto the main topic of this post: who am I and what kind of content can you expect here?

## Who am I?

My name is Steven Upton, I'm currently 22 years old and I live in the UK. I spend most of my time developing for the web; whether that's using TypeScript to build slot games for my full time job at Projected Solutions or using Dart to make the web application for [Indecks][indecks_site] - a business I founded with a couple of friends from college. When I'm not at work (and my girlfriend and daughter allow me to have some time to myself), I delve deep into my wide variety of interest (which is too many) to learn and improve in order to transform my career into the enterprising, game creating spectacular that my 12 year old self imagined it would be.

## What content will I write?

Although my interests is a grand list of which I shall not bore you with, I aim to keep this blog's content focused on Game Design and programming. The two topics for posts that currently come to mind are:

### High Concept Documents

This will be an opportunity for me to exercise my game design mind and create high concept documents for any ideas of games that I happen to think of. This will also give me an opportunity to practice my drawing "skills" in attempt to help visually describe the ideas.

### #1GAM

[#1GAM][1gam_site] stands for "One Game a Month". It's a personal challenge that you give to yourself which involves starting and finishing a game in the time frame of one month. This will be a good chance for me to practice actually developing a game and show my skills off to the world. It will also force me to make the scope for these games very small (something I always struggle with when starting personal projects).

## Who should read this?

I created this blog for documenting my journey in the world of game design. Logging my successes and failures while keeping an online portfolio of my work. If you have an interest in creating games, then I hope that you will find my content inspiring, useful and interesting.

So please, if you are one of those people, leave a comment. I am always up for networking with others and I would like to know if something on here has helped you in any way (or if you think you can help me). If you want get notified when a new post out I have included an Atom feed [here][feed_link].

Well, that concludes my first post. See you next week.
