With the help of my favourite programming language ([Dart][dartlang_site]) and this amazing, front-end hosting service called [Netlify][netlify_site], I have finally created my own blog. In a world where services like Wordpress and Blogger exist, you may ask: "Why bother creating your own blog?"

The tweet above was very close to my own thought process. Not only did I not like the current blogging solutions that were available but I would be kicking myself if I had settled with one of them knowing that I have the skills and knowledge to create my own.

So the hard part is done, the site is up and running. Now it's time for the harder part; writing content. So that leads me onto the main topic of this post: who am I and what kind of content can you expect here?

## Who am I?

My name is Steven Upton, I'm currently 22 years old and I live in the UK. I spend most of my time developing for the web; whether that's using TypeScript to build slot games for my full time job at Projected Solutions or using Dart to make the web application for [Indecks][indecks_site] - a business I founded with a couple of friends from college. When I'm not at work (and my girlfriend and daughter allow me to have some time to myself), I delve deep into my wide variety of interest to learn and improve in order to transform my career into the enterprising, game-creating spectacular that my 12 year old self imagined it would be.

## What content will I write?

Although my interests are a grand list of which I will not bore you with, I aim to keep this blog's content focused on game design and programming. The two topics for posts that currently come to mind are:

### High Concept Documents

This will be an opportunity for me to exercise my game design mind and create high concept documents for any ideas of games that I happen to think of. This will also give me the opportunity to practice my drawing "skills" in an attempt to help visually describe these ideas.

### #1GAM

[#1GAM][1gam_site] stands for "One Game a Month". It's a personal challenge that you give to yourself which involves starting and finishing a game in the time frame of one month. This will be a good chance for me to practice actually developing a game and show my skills off to the world. It will also force me to make the scope for these games very small, which is something I always struggle with when starting personal projects.

## Who should read this?

I created this blog for documenting my journey in the world of game design. Logging my successes and failures whilst keeping an online portfolio of my work. If you have an interest in creating games then I hope that you will find my content inspiring, useful and maybe even interesting.

So please, if you are one of those people, leave a comment. I am always up for networking with others and I would like to know if something on here has helped you in any way (or if you think you can help me). If you want be notified when a new post is out I have included an Atom feed [here][feed_link].

Well, that concludes my first post. See you next week.
